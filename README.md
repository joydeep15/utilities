#autoKick.c
It is a short program for ending ssh sessions of all other users except yourself. Program assumes all users are logged in under the name "user". Useful when system starts to slow down because of too many active ssh sessions.
Suitable changes can be made to the program if you are root on the systems though most systems forbid root login through ssh.
Enjoy!
